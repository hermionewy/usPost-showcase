			<h1 class='intro__hed'>Gossamer Network</h1>
			<p class='intro__dek'>In 1848, the vast majority of what would become the western United States was controlled by native people. Less than half a century later, the region had been occupied by millions of American settlers. How did this happen so quickly, in the span of a single generation? The answer lies with an unlikely source: the U.S. Post. During the nineteenth century the federal government established more than 25,000 post offices in the western United States, building a vast communications infrastructure that helped knit together an otherwise remote region. This website maps the spread of that network between 1848 to 1895.</p>

                    <p>Mapping the western postal network accomplishes two things. First, it presents an overarching geography of conquest, native dispossession, and settler expansion. We know the broad strokes of where and when the United States laid claim to different areas of the West. But at what point did these different territorial claims transform into on-the-ground reality? This website uses a dataset of post offices collected by the late stamp collector Richard Helbock to map successive six-year chunks of postal expansion. Locating all of these post offices paint a detailed picture of where and when Americans actually occupied the region’s plundered land. Read more about the methodology of this project.</p>

                    </div>
        
                    <p>Second, mapping the U.S. Post presents a new framework for thinking about state power (in this case, the U.S. federal government). The nineteenth-century American West is often described through the lens of conquest, as the U.S. government waged war against the region’s native inhabitants, seized their land, and forced them onto federal reservations. Understanding this violent, coercive form of state power is vital, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. The American state still needed to integrate all of this conquered territory into the rest of the country. To do so, it turned to less familiar forms of state power.</p>
        
        
                    <p>More so than any other government institution, the U.S. Post provided the spatial circuitry of western expansion. It did so by operating a “gossamer network,” a lightweight, sprawling, and ephemeral collection of post offices and mail routes. In most places, the U.S. Post did not own or operate its own infrastructure. Instead, it delegated small tasks to a privatized, part-time workforce. It paid local merchants to distribute letters from their stores or contracted with stagecoach companies to carry bags of mail alongside their passengers. These temporary arrangements produced a highly unstable network - western post offices might operate for just a few years or even months before changing hands or shutting down. But it was also the key mechanism that allowed the U.S. Post to move in lockstep with American settlers, rapidly expanding and contracting across the region to meet their needs as they swarmed across stolen native land. The U.S. Post was the hidden channel through which the American state consolidated its hold over the region.</p>

By December of 1865, the Confederate Rebellion had been put down and the institution of slavery officially abolished. Typically this drama has been told from the perspective of the eastern United States, on battlefields like Antietam, Shiloh, or Gettysburg or in the halls of the nation’s capital. In this standard historical narrative, the western half of the country quietly waits off-stage, out of sight. But the American West didn’t stand still during the Civil War.</p></div></p>

                                    <p>During the preceding dozen years, the U.S. Post had managed to carve out a Pacific foothold and a few scattered archipelagos of post offices, but was <span class=highlight id=westernInterior>otherwise blocked from vast expanses of the western interior.</span> In the early 1860s, that pattern changed. Gold and silver drove this shift. Historian Elliott West has described mining camps as “artillery shells” lobbed far ahead of more permanent kinds of settlement. <span class=highlight id=establishedOn>It’s an apt image to describe the clusters of post offices that exploded across the western interior between 1860 and 1865. </span></p>

The U.S. Post’s gossamer properties were on full display during these years. Despite the fact that these mining camps were tucked away in mountainous terrain, far removed from major transportation routes, the Post Office Department managed to open up dozens of new post offices up and down the Front Range.</p>

                                    <p>Colorado wasn’t alone. In <span class=highlightArea>western Nevada</span>, the discovery of silver in 1859 near the border of California led to a flurry of new post offices as prospectors staked out claims in what would become known as the Comstock Lode. Smaller silver discoveries in the Reese River District and in Humboldt County produced two more concentrated bursts of post offices in <span class=highlightArea>eastern Nevada</span>. These artillery shells gave off more light than heat - by the end of the 1860s, the silver boom had crashed and <span class=highlight id=nvDiscontinued>many of these post offices had shut down. </span></p>

When southern Congressmen vacated their seats after Confederate secession, it left the Republican Party with a commanding hold of both houses of Congress and the Presidency. They used this majority to pass a series of new laws squarely targeted at promoting settlement and investment in the western United States, part of a larger “developmental vision” of the Republican Party. Much of this legislation centered on the distribution of public land: to individual settlers (the Homestead Act), agricultural colleges (the Morrill Act), and transcontinental railroad companies (the Pacific Railway Acts). The effects of this war-time legislation would reverberate across the West for years to come.</p><h3>1866-1871: CORRIDORS</h3><p>The Republican Party’s seeds for a government-backed expansion project in the West began to sprout in the wake of the Civil War. The most famous of these came with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, an infrastructure project that was made possible by vast public land grants to the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads. It embodied one of the main patterns of expansion during this period: corridors. </p></div></p>

                                    <p>The transcontinental corridor across the Central Plains, Rocky Mountains, and Great Basin was built on a foundation of native dispossession. Over the course of the 1860s, government officials negotiated treaties with native tribes that seized millions of acres of their land, including the  <span class=highlight id=AraChe>Arapahoe and Cheyenne</span> in 1861, the <span class=highlight id=Shoshone>Shoshone</span> in 1863, the <span class=highlight id=Washoe>Washoe</span> in 1865, and the <span class=highlight id=ShoBan>Shoshone and Bannock</span> in 1868. <span class=highlight id=spotlightRailroad>As workers laid down nearly 1,700 miles of railroad tracks across this territory, the U.S. Post quietly expanded a string of post offices through this corridor. </span></p>

                                    <p>The impact of the transcontinental railroad on Anglo-American settlement rippled out from either end of the route. In the west, California’s postal system surged in the immediate aftermath of the transcontinental railroad, much of it along a web of new railroad spokes that radiated out from Sacramento and the Bay Area.</p>

                                    <p>In the east, a wave of settlers flooded <span class=highlightArea>the prairies of southeastern Nebraska and eastern Kansas</span>, pulling the nation’s postal system with them. By 1870-1871, Kansas was adding more new post offices than any other state in the country.</p>

                                    <p>Other sorts of corridors crystalized during the late 1860s. A number of transportation routes began to radiate out from <span class=highlightArea>Denver, Colorado</span>, establishing the young city as the central hub of the Mountain West. New mail routes and post offices unfurled along railroad branch lines and the newly completed Kansas Pacific Railroad.</p>

                                    <p><span class=highlight id=spotlightSouth>Farther south</span>, a band of new post offices swept down the eastern face of the Rocky Mountains and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to Santa Fe, New Mexico before narrowing down to the Rio Grande River artery that ran south to El Paso, Texas, and the Mexican border.</p>

                                    <p>Elsewhere, Americans hungry for gold and silver ventured into remote areas of the western interior. These mining ventures produced a now-familiar artillery-shell pattern of postal infrastructure. The largest barrage came in <span class=highlight id=spotlightWMo>western Montana, where the discovery of gold led to the establishment of some eighty new post offices between 1866-1871</span>. Compared to the earlier mineral rushes in California and Colorado, this mining boom has received comparatively little attention. But postal growth shows just how quickly these gold strikes transformed the southwestern corner of Montana. <span class=highlight id=spotlightNevada>In Nevada, silver prospectors and mining companies fanned out across the state and dragged the nation’s postal network with them, establishing ninety new offices in the span of six years</span>. In both mining zones, however, much of this new postal infrastructure proved to be ephemeral: <span class=highlight id=discontinuedMoNe>sixty of the new post offices in Montana and Nevada would either shut down or change names within just five years of opening</span>.</p>

                                    <p>Despite the best efforts of the U.S. Government, large pockets of the West continued to remain off-limits to Anglo-American settlement through the end of the 1860s. <span class=highlight id=spotlightPowderRiver>The most extreme example came in the Powder River Country of northern Wyoming, southern Montana, and western Dakota Territory.</span> There, an alliance led by seven Lakota tribes had effectively repelled the U.S. Army and extracted sweeping concessions from the federal government, including the expulsion of troops and settlers from the area. The lack of postal infrastructure across this huge tract of land tells a story about the persistence of native power and the geographical limits of settler expansion. That story was about to change.</p>
