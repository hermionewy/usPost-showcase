			<h1 class='intro__hed'>Gossamer Network</h1>
			<p class='intro__dek'>In 1848, the vast majority of what would become the western United States was controlled by native people. Less than half a century later, the region had been occupied by millions of American settlers. How did this happen so quickly, in the span of a single generation? The answer lies with an unlikely source: the U.S. Post. During the nineteenth century the federal government established more than 25,000 post offices in the western United States, building a vast communications infrastructure that helped knit together an otherwise remote region. This website maps the spread of that network between 1848 to 1895.<sup class=reference><a href=”#”></a></sup></p>

                                    <p>Despite what Hollywood might tell you, the history of the American West is not a story about rugged cowboys and brave pioneers. It is a story about big government. The most visible way in which the U.S. government (or, the American state) shaped the region was through <b>coercive power</b>: waging war against indigenous peoples, seizing their land, and forcing the survivors onto reservations. You can see the state’s coercive power by mapping unceded <span class=NativeLandBG>native land</span> and <span class=ReservationLandBG>government reservations</span> over time. <br/>Toggle the switch to compare<span class=switchSpan id=switch1848> 1848</span> <label class=switch><input id=introSwitch type=checkbox><span class=switchSlider></span></label> <span class=switchSpan id=switch1877>1877</span>. <br/><br/><i>Data from Invasion of America project.</i></p>

                                    <p>Coercive power was important, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Settlers still had to occupy this plundered native land. To help them, the federal government turned to a much less visible kind of state power: <b>the U.S. Post</b>. As farmers, ranchers, and miners colonized remote corners of the West, they could depend on the world’s largest communications network to expand alongside them. <br/>You can see the spread of this network using a dataset of post offices collected by the late postal historian and philatelist Richard Helbock. Each pink dot <span class=colorExisting>⬤</span> represents one post office <b>existing</b> at that time. <br/> <b>Click the button below to see the U.S. Post expand in the West on different time periods.</b><br/><button class=btn-compare id=intro1-1848>1848-1853</button> <button class=btn-compare id=intro1-1871>1871-1876</button> <button class=btn-compare id=intro1-1890>1890-1895</button></p>

                                    <p>The U.S. Post was <b>expansive</b> and <b>fast-moving</b>. Between 1848 and 1895 the federal government established roughly 24,000 western post offices. It was able to rapidly occupy some of the region’s least accessible areas, from the <span class=highlight id=spotlightChihuahuan>Chihuahuan Desert</span> to the <span class=highlight id=spotlightCBasin>Central Basin</span> to the <span class=highlight id=spotlightNRockies>Northern Rockies</span>.

                                    <p>The U.S. Post’s ability to rapidly expand into remote places helped settlers colonize the West while staying connected to the rest of the country. They used the mail to exchange letters with friends and family, subscribe to newspapers and magazines, or conduct long-distance financial transactions. The real power of the western postal network, however, came from its geography: the U.S. Post operated in more places - by far - than any other government institution. <br/>To see the spatial coverage of the U.S. Post, try comparing it to other federal organizations in the West in the year 1877:<br/><button class=department id=introPost>U.S. Post</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Military>Military</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Judiciary>Judiciary</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Interior>Department of the Interior</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Treasury>Treasury Department</button></p>

                                    <p>Even more surprisingly, the western postal infrastructure was <b>highly unstable</b>. Between 1848 and 1895, thousands of post offices either shut down or changed names/locations. Some of these offices operated for just a few years or even months before closing down.

These temporary and part-time arrangements explain how the U.S. Post was able to expand so quickly, into so many different places - and why its network was so unstable.

                                    <p>Historical data comes with limitations, and this project is no different. Its first limitation is <b>imprecise data</b>. The <a href=http://invasionofamerica.ehistory.org target=_blank>Invasion of America</a> project generously provided data about native land cessions mapped from federal treaties, executive orders, and government maps. These documents were intentionally vague, making it difficult to precisely delineate between unceded native land, government reservations, and colonized territory. To take one example: a treaty in 1855 established a common hunting ground for the Blackfoot, Salish and Kootenai (Flathead), and Nez Perce. Although classified as a “reservation” on this map, <span class=highlightNative id=introReservation>its borders didn’t mean much</span>: by the 1870s thousands of settlers and goldseekers had occupied this area. The second limitation is <b>missing data</b>. Thousands of post offices from Richard Helbock’s dataset - roughly one out of every three - could not be located and therefore do not show up on the maps.</p>

In January, James Marshall discovered gold outside of Sacramento, California. Nine days after Marshall’s discovery, the United States seized roughly half a million square miles of territory from Mexico in exchange for ending the American invasion and occupation of its southern neighbor. Parts of this land would later become the states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, and, finally, California and its newfound gold. </p></div></p>

                                    <p>The discovery of gold and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo touched off a global stampede to the American West, unleashing a wave of new settlement into freshly conquered territory. That, at least, is how the story goes. In reality, the overwhelming majority of the West was not yet controlled by the United States. It was <span class=NativeLandBG>native land</span>. Thousands of different groups occupied the region, from <span class=highlightNative id=ForaysApaches>Apache</span> in the Southwest to <span class=highlightNative id=UtesCo>Utes in the Colorado Plateau</span> to <span class=highlightNative id=Blackfoot>Blackfoot</span> on the northern plains.

Much maligned at the time for its slowness, delays, and lost letters, the U.S. Post nevertheless managed to shuttle correspondence thousands of miles between remote mining camps and an American populace hungry for news and information about the gold rush. To the north, <span class=highlight id=foraysOR>a second pocket of post offices appeared in Oregon</span>, snaking south down the Willamette Valley alongside new farms and towns. Postal expansion along the Pacific Coast was made possible by a brutal campaign to exterminate and remove the area’s native inhabitants, paving the way for settlers to occupy <span class=highlightNative id=foraysNative>this plundered land.</span></p>

                                    <p>The presence of native peoples didn’t stop Americans from traveling across the West.

Outside of <span class=highlight id=MormonUtah>Mormon settlements in Utah Territory</span>, a scattering of <span class=highlight id=RioGrande>new offices in the Rio Grande Valley</span>, and a few isolated military forts, native power largely stymied postal growth through the end of the decade.</p>

                                    <p>Western land, minerals, crops, and livestock fed the engines of a rapidly industrializing nation. But the region’s dependence on extractive industry and eastern capital made for a volatile economy. In fact, no other region has become so synonymous with a “boom-and-bust” economy, as periods of spectacular growth - mining strikes, cattle rushes, real-estate bubbles - were followed by ecological and financial collapse. The late 1870s witnessed one of these classic western booms. As the nation recovered from an economic depression, people and capital surged westward between 1878-1883. So, too, did the U.S. Post, <span class=highlight id=churn-establishedOn>establishing more than 5,000 new post offices to serve the region’s new farms, mines, ranches, and railroads.</span></p>

But a closer look at the western postal network during 1878-1883 shows a different sort of pattern. Postal growth and postal failure were simultaneous, not sequential. Instead of a distinctive “boom” phase followed by a “bust” phase, both post office openings and post office closings rocketed upwards during 1878-1883. It was not boom <i>then</i> bust; it was boom <i>with</i> bust.

Much of this expansion followed a “churn” model of growth, as more than one thousand post offices in these two states <span class=highlightDiscontinued id=churn_period> either shut down or changed names or locations during this six-year period</span>. Unstable as it may have been, this expansionary infrastructure provided settlers with a vital public service - one that continued to wither away at the borders of Indian Territory.</p>

Railroads  <span class=highlight id=churn_NPacific>like the Northern Pacific</span> fueled some of this growth. So, too, did native dispossession. In 1879, President Rutherford Hayes issued an executive order opening up  <span class=highlightNative id=churn_Lakota>land that had been reserved for the Lakota Sioux</span>. The following year, officials forced additional cessions from the  <span class=highlightNative id=churn_Arikara>Arikara, Gros Ventre, and Mandan</span>.

Congress opened up this area for white settlement in 1882, and over the next eighteen months dozens of new post offices swept across plundered land.

Nearly <span class=highlightDiscontinued id=churn_ephemeral>four hundred post offices either closed or changed names/locations</span> in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah between 1878-1883; of these, half had been in operation for less than two years.</p>

                                    <p>To the north, political integration brought about a similar loss of land for native peoples living in the Great Sioux Reservation. On February 22, 1889, Congress voted to divide Dakota Territory in half and admit North and South Dakota as two new states. Eight days later, those same Congressmen voted to split apart the Great Sioux Reservation within Dakota <span class=highlightNative id=integration-six>into six smaller agencies and open up nine million acres of land to white settlers</span>. As soon as this legislation went into effect in early 1890,  <span class=highlightNative id=integration-corridor>a string of post offices began to carve a corridor across this territory</span>.</p>

                                    <p>Western integration galloped onwards in the Central Plains with the incorporation of <span class=highlightNative id=integration-Ok>Oklahoma Territory</span> in 1890. But Oklahoma wasn’t conjured out of thin air; it was cleaved off from <span class=highlightNative id=integration-In>Indian Territory</span>. Oklahoma Territory grew even larger in 1893 when the U.S. Government forced the Cherokee to sell their rights to some eight million additional acres known as the <span class=highlightNative id=integration-Cherokee>“Cherokee Outlet.”</span> At noon on September 16, 1893, government officials opened up this area to non-native settlers. Within a matter of hours, thousands of people had laid claim to plots of land. And within a matter of months, the U.S. Post was bringing them their mail <span class=highlightNative id=integration-dense>across a dense network of new post offices</span>. As it had for decades, native dispossession and postal expansion went hand-in-hand.</p>

                                    <p>Immediately to the north, Kansas and Nebraska experienced the downsides of economic integration. Farmers faced a deflationary economy, crippling drought, and, beginning in 1893, one of the worst economic depressions in American history. Postal growth nosedived and Kansas and Nebraska’s post office coverage began to steadily shrink. What had once been an engine for the west’s roiling growth had turned into an area littered with <span class=highlightDiscontinued id=integration-failed>failed communities</span>. This landscape of postal collapse was the backdrop for the concurrent rise of the People’s Party, an agrarian political insurgency that originated on the central plains and swept across the western United States during the early 1890s.<br/>Growth in <button class=btn-compare id=integration2-1884>1884-1889</button> vs. Growth in <button class=btn-compare id=integration2-1890>1890-1895</button></p>

                                    <p>The colonization and integration of the western United States represented one of the most dramatic transformations of people, land, and resources in American history. Different processes drove these changes - warfare and dispossession, ______ and industrialization - but underlying them all was the quiet infrastructure of the U.S. Post. The federal government’s ability to rapidly extend its postal network into otherwise remote places provided American colonizers with vital lines of communication to the wider world. It didn’t have to be this way. The U.S. Post could have expanded more slowly, more cautiously, and with more limited coverage. Western expansion still would have taken place, but its pace would have been slower, its prosecution more difficult, and its reach more limited. Instead, the U.S. Post’s expansive gossamer network helped to accelerate the transition from <button class=btn-compare id=integration-native>native territory</button> into a <button class=btn-compare id=integration-colonized>colonized American region</button>.</p>
