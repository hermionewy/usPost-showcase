			<h1 class='intro__hed'>Gossamer Network</h1>
			<p class='intro__dek'>In 1848, the vast majority of what would become the western United States was controlled by native people. Less than half a century later, the region had been occupied by millions of American settlers. How did this happen so quickly, in the span of a single generation? The answer lies with an unlikely source: the U.S. Post. During the nineteenth century the federal government established more than 25,000 post offices in the western United States, building a vast communications infrastructure that helped knit together an otherwise remote region. This website maps the spread of that network between 1848 to 1895.<sup class=reference><a href=”#”></a></sup></p>

        <div class="allIntro">
                    <p>Mapping the western postal network accomplishes two things. First, it presents an overarching geography of conquest, native dispossession, and settler expansion. We know the broad strokes of where and when the United States laid claim to different areas of the West. But at what point did these different territorial claims transform into on-the-ground reality? This website uses a dataset of post offices collected by the late stamp collector Richard Helbock to map successive six-year chunks of postal expansion. Locating all of these post offices paint a detailed picture of where and when Americans actually occupied the region’s plundered land. Read more about the methodology of this project<sup class=reference><a href=”#”></a></sup>.</p>

                    </div>
        
                    <p>Second, mapping the U.S. Post presents a new framework for thinking about state power (in this case, the U.S. federal government). The nineteenth-century American West is often described through the lens of conquest, as the U.S. government waged war against the region’s native inhabitants, seized their land, and forced them onto federal reservations. Understanding this violent, coercive form of state power is vital, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. The American state still needed to integrate all of this conquered territory into the rest of the country. To do so, it turned to less familiar forms of state power<sup class=reference><a href=”#”></a></sup>.</p>
        
        
                    <p>More so than any other government institution, the U.S. Post provided the spatial circuitry of western expansion. It did so by operating a “gossamer network,” a lightweight, sprawling, and ephemeral collection of post offices and mail routes. In most places, the U.S. Post did not own or operate its own infrastructure. Instead, it delegated small tasks to a privatized, part-time workforce. It paid local merchants to distribute letters from their stores or contracted with stagecoach companies to carry bags of mail alongside their passengers. These temporary arrangements produced a highly unstable network - western post offices might operate for just a few years or even months before changing hands or shutting down. But it was also the key mechanism that allowed the U.S. Post to move in lockstep with American settlers, rapidly expanding and contracting across the region to meet their needs as they swarmed across stolen native land. The U.S. Post was the hidden channel through which the American state consolidated its hold over the region.</p>

When southern Congressmen vacated their seats after Confederate secession, it left the Republican Party with a commanding hold of both houses of Congress and the Presidency. They used this majority to pass a series of new laws targeted at promoting settlement and investment in the western United States, part of a larger “developmental vision” of the Republican Party. Much of this legislation centered on the distribution of public land: to individual settlers (the Homestead Act), state colleges (the Morrill Act), and railroad companies (the Pacific Railway Acts). The effects of this war-time legislation would reverberate across the West for years to come.</p><h3>1848-1853: FORAYS</h3><p>Gold and conquest. This is the typical story of the year 1848. In January, James Marshall discovered gold outside of Sacramento, California. Eight days after Marshall’s discovery, the United States seized roughly half a million square miles of territory from Mexico in exchange for ending its invasion and occupation of its southern neighbor. Parts of this land would later become the states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, and, finally, California and its newfound gold. </p></div></p>

                                    <p>The discovery of gold and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo touched off a global stampede to the American West, unleashing a wave of new settlement into freshly conquered territory. That, at least, is how the story goes. In reality, the overwhelming majority of the West was not yet controlled by the United States. It was <span class=NativeLandBG>native land</span>.

                                    <p>Again and again, American settlers were able to mobilize the U.S. Post to help them colonize native land. In the southwestern corner of Colorado, white settlers had been banned from the San Juan Mountains as part of an 1868 agreement with the Ute tribe. Almost immediately, prospectors started making illegal forays into Ute territory in search of gold and silver. In the spring of 1874 government officials negotiated the cession of <span class=highlightNative id=col_Ute>3.7 million acres of Ute land</span>. Miners and settlers immediately swarmed into this otherwise remote area, confident that the U.S. Post’s connective infrastructure would expand alongside them. <br/><button class=btn-compare id=col3-before>Before</button> vs <button class=btn-compare id=col3-after>After</button></p>

                                    <p>In the Pacific Northwest, a cluster of new post offices sprouted up in eastern Washington and northern Idaho, extending across territory that the U.S. Government had seized from the <span class=highlightNative id=col_Methow>Methow and Okanagan</span> and <span class=highlightNative id=col_Cour>Cour d’Alene</span> groups. A similar pattern unfolded in northern California and southern Oregon, where the government had seized land from the <span class=highlightNative id=col_Klamath>Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin band of Snake Indians</span> in the 1860s. In 1872-1873, the U.S. Army put down a small-scale insurgency of Modocs, paving the way for <span class=highlight id=col_expansion>accelerated postal expansion in the area</span>.</p>

                                    <p>The U.S. Government forced surviving Modocs from the 1872-1873 war to relocate to <span class=highlight id=col_Indian>Indian Territory</span>, part of a wider campaign that began in the 1830s to violently remove native people from their land. By the late 1870s, the American state had confined some two-dozen groups within a patchwork of government-run reservations. Many suffered from a chronic lack of food, supplies, and other government-provided resources. This included postal infrastructure, as <span class=highlight id=col_Indian_otherwise>the otherwise dense postal coverage in surrounding states all but ground to a halt at the borders of Indian Territory</span>. The relatively few post offices operating in Indian Territory were located mainly at agency offices, railroad depots, and army forts, serving the needs of government officials rather than native inhabitants. In a pattern that continues to this day, white settlers could rely on an expansive government service while native people could not.</p>

The prior three decades had revolved around the conquest and occupation of territory, as the U.S. government seized native land for American settlers to colonize. Violence and dispossession would continue, but by the late 1870s the U.S. Government had effectively conquered the region. Increasingly, it turned towards integrating this plundered territory into the nation. The U.S. Post was the quiet government channel that facilitated this process.</p></div></p>

                                    <p>Western land, minerals, crops, and livestock fed the engines of a rapidly industrializing nation. But the region’s dependence on extractive industry and eastern capital made for a volatile economy. In fact, no other region has become so synonymous with a “boom-and-bust” economy, as periods of spectacular growth - mining strikes, cattle rushes, real-estate bubbles - were followed by ecological and financial collapse. The late 1870s witnessed one of these classic western booms. As the nation recovered an economic depression, people and capital surged westward between 1878-1883. So, too, did the U.S. Post, <span class=highlight id=churn-establishedOn>establishing more than 5,000 new post offices to serve the region’s new farms, mines, ranches, and railroads.</span></p>

                                    <p>"Boom-and-bust" is, above all, a sequential model: first the bender, then the hangover. But a closer look at the western postal network during 1878-1883 shows a different sort of pattern. Postal growth and postal failure were simultaneous, not sequential. Instead of a distinctive “boom” phase followed by a “bust” phase, both post office openings and post office closings rocketed upwards during 1878-1883. It was not boom <i>then</i> bust; it was boom <i>with</i> bust. In a word: <b>churn</b>.  <br/><button class=btn-compare id=churn-established>Established Post Offices</button> <button class=btn-compare id=churn-discontinued> Discontinued Post Offices</button></p>

                                    <p>On the central and southern plains, aspiring homesteaders and a “ranch rush” of cattle and sheep moved into drier and drier environments. The U.S. Post moved with them, <span class=highlight id=churn_Texas>continuing to thicken its network in central Texas and western Kansas</span>. As aridity increased, so did instability. Much of this expansion followed a “churn” model of growth, as more than one thousand post offices in these two <span class=highlightDiscontinued id=churn_period>states either shut down or changed names or locations during this six-year period</span>. Unstable as it may have been, this expansionary infrastructure provided settlers with a vital public service - one that continued to wither away at the borders of Indian Territory.</p>

                                    <p>To the north, the late 1870s kicked off a frenzied rush of settlers across the northern plains known as the “Great Dakota Boom.” The territory’s postal network underwent its own boom during these years, as the number of post offices in Dakota  <span class=highlight id=churn_Dakota>more than tripled between 1878-1883</span>. Railroads  <span class=highlight id=churn_NPacific>like the Northern Pacific</span> fueled some of this growth. So, too, did native dispossession. In 1879, President Rutherford Hayes issued an executive order opening up  <span class=highlightNative id=churn_Lakota>land that had been reserved for the Lakota Sioux</span>. The following year, officials forced additional cessions from the  <span class=highlightNative id=churn_Arikara>Arikara, Gros Ventre, and Mandan</span>. In both cases,  <span class=highlight id=churn_gossamer>the U.S. Post's expansionary gossamer network rapidly occupied this plundered territory</span>.</p>

                                    <p>Conquest and colonization continued in western Colorado, where a splinter group of White River Utes launched an insurgency against local government officials in 1879. The federal government used this as a pretext to expel not only the White River Utes, but also the Uncompahgre and Southern Utes, all of whom <span class=highlightNative id=churn_Utes>ceded some six million combined acres of territory</span>. Congress opened up this area for white settlement in 1882, and over the next eighteen months dozens of new post offices swept across plundered land. The U.S. Post once again helped the American state transform indigenous territory into a colonized landscape. <br/><button class=btn-compare id=churn-1877>1877</button> vs <button class=btn-compare id=churn-1883> 1883</button></p>

                                    <p>The U.S. Post facilitated a churning brand of colonization that reached its peak in the Mountain West. From 1878-1883, mines and railroads spurred much of the area’s postal growth. Silver mining proliferated in <span class=highlight id=churn_Co>Colorado</span> and <span class=highlight id=churn_Az>Arizona</span>, spurred in part by the Bland-Allison Act of 1878 that required the U.S. Treasury to buy, mint, and circulate silver currency. Other post offices opened alongside new railroad lines and branches in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. Much of this new postal infrastructure proved remarkably ephemeral. Nearly <span class=highlightDiscontinued id=churn_ephemeral>four hundred post offices either closed or changed names/locations</span> in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah between 1878-1883; of these, half had been in operation for less than two years.</p>

                                    <p>Industrial expansion similarly shaped postal growth in the northern Mountain West. The Northern Pacific Railroad completed a transcontinental route while the Union Pacific Railroad extended spur lines through the area. By 1883, these railroads were carrying gold, silver, lead, timber, and livestock, and a <span class=highlight id=churn_burst>burst of new postal infrastructure</span> helped connect otherwise remote mining camps, sawmills, and ranching communities. Once again, growth went hand-in-hand with failure: <span class=highlightDiscontinued id=churn_failure>more than two hundred post offices shut down</span> in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming during this six-year-period.</p>

Thousands of settlers filed for land patents along new railroad lines that brought them steadily into drier and drier climates <span class=highlight id=divergence-Ks>in western Kansas and Nebraska</span>. But twin disasters struck in 1886-1887: a crippling drought followed by one of the worst winters in living memory.
