			<h1 class='intro__hed'>Gossamer Network</h1>
			<p class='intro__dek'>In 1848, the large majority of what would become the western United States was controlled by native people. Over the following years the U.S. Government would launch an all-out assault on native sovereignty in the West, and by century’s end millions of American settlers had successfully occupied every corner of the West. How did this happen so quickly, in the span of a single generation? The answer lies, in part, with an unlikely source: the U.S. Post. During the nineteenth century the federal government established more than 25,000 post offices in the western United States, building a vast communications infrastructure that helped knit together an otherwise sprawling and remote region. The U.S. Post provided the spatial circuitry of settler occupation in the West. This website maps the spread of that network between 1848 to 1895.</p>

                                    <p>Coercive power was important, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Settlers still had to occupy this plundered native land. To help them, the federal government turned to a much less visible kind of state power: <b>the U.S. Post</b>. As farmers, ranchers, and miners colonized remote corners of the West, they could depend on the world’s largest communications network to expand alongside them.<sup class=reference><a href=“#”></a></sup><br/><br/>You can see the spread of this network using a dataset of post offices collected by the postal historian and philatelist Richard Helbock.

The real power of the western postal network, however, came from its geography: the U.S. Post operated in more places - by far - than any other government institution.<sup class=reference><a href=“#”></a></sup> <br/><br/>To see the spatial coverage of the U.S. Post, try comparing it to other federal organizations in the West in the year 1877:<br/><button class=department id=introPost>U.S. Post</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Military>Military</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Judiciary>Judiciary</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Interior>Department of the Interior</button><br/><button class=department id=btn_Treasury>Treasury Department</button></p>

On January 24th, James Marshall discovered gold outside of Sacramento, California. Nine days after Marshall’s discovery, the United States seized roughly half a million square miles of territory from Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in exchange for ending the American invasion and occupation of its southern neighbor.

That, at least, is how the story goes. In reality, the overwhelming majority of the West was not yet controlled by the United States. It was <span class=NativeLandBG>native land</span>. Thousands of different groups occupied the region, from <span class=highlightNative id=ForaysApaches>Apache</span> groups in the Southwest to <span class=highlightNative id=UtesCo>Utes in the Colorado Plateau</span> to <span class=highlightNative id=Blackfoot>Blackfoot</span> on the northern plains.

To the north, <span class=highlight id=foraysOR>a second pocket of post offices appeared in Oregon</span>, snaking south down the Willamette Valley alongside new farms and towns.

In fact, no other region has become so synonymous with a “boom-and-bust” economy, as periods of spectacular growth - mining strikes, cattle rushes, real-estate bubbles - were followed by ecological and financial collapse. The late 1870s witnessed one of these classic western booms. As the nation recovered from an economic depression, people and capital surged westward between 1878-1883. So, too, did the U.S. Post, <span class=highlight id=churn-establishedOn>establishing more than 5,000 new post offices to serve the region’s new farms, mines, ranches, and railroads.</span><sup class=reference><a href=“#”></a></sup></p>

Instead of a distinctive “boom” phase followed by a “bust” phase, both post office openings and post office closings rocketed upwards during 1878-1883. It was not boom <i>then</i> bust; it was boom <i>with</i> bust.

As unstable as Kansas’s postal infrastructure may have been, its residents could still rely on an expansive communications infrastructure. Native residents in Indian Territory could not. This disparity came into even starker relief in early 1889, when the federal government negotiated a large land cession from the Muscogee that opened up so-called <span class=highlightNative id=divergence-unassigned>“Unassigned Lands”</span> to settlers. When the dust cleared, thousands of settlers had claimed nearly two million acres of land in one of the most famous land rushes in American history. Within a matter of months, the Post Office Department established a dozen new post offices in an area that it had previously ignored.<sup class=reference><a href=“#”></a></sup> <br/> <button class=btn-compare id=divergence-1888>1888</button> vs <button class=btn-compare id=divergence-1890>1890</button></p>

                                    <p>In just eight months spanning November 1889 to July 1890, Congress admitted six new western states: <span class=highlightNative id=integration-ND>North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming</span>. Political integration went hand-in-hand with economic integration, as western ore, timber, crops, and livestock traveled across a growing <span class=highlightTrail id=RegionalTrail>regional railway network</span> to eastern cities and factories.

                                    <p>Political integration brought about a loss of land for native peoples living in the Great Sioux Reservation. On February 22, 1889, Congress voted to divide Dakota Territory in half and admit North and South Dakota as two new states. Eight days later, those same Congressmen voted to split apart the Great Sioux Reservation <span class=highlightNative id=integration-six>into six smaller agencies and open up nine million acres of land to white settlers</span>. As soon as this legislation went into effect in early 1890,  <span class=highlightNative id=integration-corridor>a string of new post offices started to carve a corridor through this seized land</span>.<sup class=reference><a href=“#”></a></sup></p>

But Oklahoma wasn’t conjured out of thin air; it was cleaved off from <span class=highlightNative id=integration-In>Indian Territory</span> in 1890. Settlers occupied the area in a series of government-managed land rushes, the largest of which came on September 16, 1893 when the so-called <span class=highlightNative id=integration-Cherokee>“Cherokee Outlet”</span> was opened to non-native settlers. Within a matter of hours, tens of thousands of people had swarmed over this land.

Farmers faced a deflationary economy, crippling drought, and, beginning in 1893, one of the worst economic depressions in American history. Postal growth nosedived and Kansas and Nebraska’s postal coverage started to steadily shrink. What had once been an engine for the west’s roiling growth had turned into an area littered with <span class=highlightDiscontinued id=integration-failed>failed communities</span>. This landscape of postal collapse was the backdrop for the concurrent rise of the People’s Party, an agrarian political insurgency that originated on the central plains and swept across the western United States during the early 1890s.<sup class=reference><a href=“#”></a></sup><br/>Established post offices in <button class=btn-compare id=integration2-1884>1884-1889</button> vs. <button class=btn-compare id=integration2-1890>1890-1895</button></p>

                                    <p>The colonization and integration of the western United States represented one of the most dramatic transformations of people, land, and resources in American history. Different processes drove these changes - warfare and dispossession, settler colonialism and industrialization - but underlying them all was the quiet infrastructure of the U.S. Post. The federal government’s ability to rapidly extend its postal network into otherwise remote places provided American colonizers with vital lines of communication to the wider world. It didn’t have to be this way. The U.S. Post could have expanded more slowly, more cautiously, and with more limited coverage. Western expansion still would have taken place, but its pace would have been slower, its prosecution more difficult, and its reach more limited. Instead, the U.S. Post’s expansive gossamer network helped to accelerate the transition from <button class=btn-compare id=integration-native>native territory</button> into a <button class=btn-compare id=integration-colonized>colonized American region</button>.</p>
