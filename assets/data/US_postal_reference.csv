cite_ref-5,"I have chosen the year 1877 because it marked a culmination of the project described by Elliott West as ""Greater Reconstruction"" in the West. The government’s large-scale military mobilizations against western tribes were winding down, and the state was building up its civilian infrastructure in order to administer all of this conquered territory, making it an ideal time to examine the state's larger geography in the region. Elliott West, <i>The Last Indian War: The Nez Perce Story</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009). Data for the Judiciary, Department of the Interior, and the Treasury Department in 1877 come from <i>The Official Register of the United States, 1877</i> (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1877).

It is important to note that this map only captures the places where people were stationed according to official government records, but people didn’t always stay put: soldiers on patrol might range hundreds of miles from a fort, or a government surveyor might lead a mapping expedition far away from his office. Relatedly, the maps do not show other government agents who “resided” in Washington, DC, but may have nonetheless traveled or worked in the western United States. ",cite_note-5,,,
